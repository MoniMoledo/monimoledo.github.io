During this internship, I have been working on the team that builds and manages internal tools for our data teams and data scientists, such as data presentation, discovery, governance and analysis tools. In this team, I have been working on: \n\n-  Learning analytics products and user interaction requirements since we build end-to-end solutions. For that I have been working with mainly Ruby on Rails or Python, using Flask and SQL Alchemy,  web applications. \n\n- Building structured streaming pipelines with Apache Spark, using both Scala and pySpark.\n\n- Analytical columnar databases and distributed query engines such as Presto, Redshift and Hive, extracting, modeling, transforming and querying data to understand, enable and produce the best insights to our teams.\n\n- Monitoring through dashboards and alerts on Splunk, Datadog and custom alerts.",

      "description": "Stone is the biggest independent payments acquirer in Brazil. I was part of the clearing/settlement team, in which we had to process all the transactions, transform its data and successfully communicate it to the different credit card brands. During the 1 year and 6 months I've spent on this team, I had experience with:\n\n- Managing the project of integrating with Elo, a new credit card brand in Brazil. What demanded high understanding and planning of requirements, scalability and good communication dealing with an external company. Adding Elo to Stone's accepted brands increased the volume of transactions done through our payments system in 30%.\n\n- C#, .NET framework services that would process the transactions in batches. Those solutions needed to be highly available, scalable and resilient since they would process all the financial flow of the company.\n\n- Building a service for calculation of the MasterCard interchange rate.\n\n- Changing a monolithic architecture to a microservices one using RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.\n\n- Database remodeling and migration on SQL Server and query improvement, since processing time was crucial.\n\n- Agile development methodologies such as Scrum and/or Kanban\n\n- Best practices with logging and monitoring, using Datazen, Kibana and Splunk dashboards and alerts.\n\n- Management and configuration of deployment with GoCD and Docker.",

In order to do that I expanded the sources of data crawled to include news websites and then I built a process to clean and geographically classify the data.",
