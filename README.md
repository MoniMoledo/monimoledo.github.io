### Description

For the 2018's version of my website I wanted to build something simpler with clear info and that was easy to read. I also wanted to build it in React, as it the technology I'm more comfortable with, so I came up with this. 

### Technologies

To build the website, I've used [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a tool that eases up the process of extracting the static files of the React application and let them ready to be deployed to Github. As well as react, es6, webpack, html5 and styled-components.

### Build your own version

I wanted to build something that could easily be reused by someone else, developers and also people who doesn't know how to code a website, so I created a [config](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/thiagoloschi.github.com/blob/develop/src/config.json) file that gives you full control over the site's content. By changing this file, you can adapt the website to your own experiences and whithin some minutes, build your own personal website.

### Development

This time I decided not to open pull requests as I usually do. Instead, the code was written on the [develop](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/thiagoloschi.github.com) branch and deployed to the [master](https://github.com/thiagoloschi/thiagoloschi.github.com/tree/master) branch.


### Demo

A demo can be seen live at [thiagoloschi.com](https://thiagoloschi). I'll edit this document with one more use case when there's any.
